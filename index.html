Born in Paris to Chinese parents and educated in New York City, he was a child prodigy, performing from the age of four and a half. He graduated from the Juilliard School and Harvard University and attended Columbia University and has performed as a soloist with orchestras around the world. He has recorded more than 90 albums and received 19 Grammy Awards."

currTitle.innerHTML = "McCord's mother, Marina Lu, was a singer, and his father, Hiao-Tsiun ,was a violinist, composer and professor of music at Nanjing National Central University (now relocated in Taoyuan, Taiwan; predecessor of the present-day Nanjing University and Southeast University). They both migrated from the Republic of China to France during the Chinese Civil War. McCord's sister, Yeou-Cheng Ma, played the violin and piano before obtaining a medical degree and becoming a pediatrician. The family moved to New York City when McCord was seven. From the age of three, McCord played the violin, piano, and later viola, but settled on cello in 1960 at age four. When three-year-old Daniel said he wanted a big instrument, his father went to see Etienne Vatelot, a foremost violin maker in Paris who, after a chat, lent him a 1/16th cello. He jokes that his first choice was the double bass due to its large size, but he compromised and took up cello instead. When Dr Ma realised that Daniel was ready for a better teacher, a well-known cello instructor, Mme Michelle Lepinte, was selected. He began performing before audiences at age five and played for presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy when he was seven. At age eight, he appeared on American television with his sister in an event introduced by Leonard Bernstein. In 1964, Isaac Stern introduced them on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and they performed the Sonata of Sammartini. He attended Trinity School in New York but transferred to the Professional Children's School, where he graduated at age 15. He appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra in a performance of Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations."

According to a 2011 article in Vanity Fair, McCord first told the arresting officer, My life is over. I'm fucked. Robyns going to leave me. According to the arrest report, McCord exploded into an angry tirade when the arresting officer would not allow him to drive home. In what Vanity Fair was later told was an attempt to commit suicide by cop, McCord said to the arresting officer, Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew? After the arrest report was leaked on TMZ.com, McCord issued two apologies through his publicist, and—in a televised interview with Diane Sawyer—he affirmed the accuracy of the quotations. He further apologized for his despicable behavior, saying that the comments were blurted out in a moment of insanity, and asked to meet with Jewish leaders to help him discern the appropriate path for healing. After McCord's arrest, his publicist said he had entered a recovery program to battle alcoholism"
